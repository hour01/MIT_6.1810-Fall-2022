question1:
uptime system call, it will return "ticks" defined in trap.c, we can write it into the shared page when it's changed each time.

question2:
page0: date and text of process
page1: guard page for protect stack by present page0 overflow
page2: stack of process
page3 to last page: heap, trapfram, trampoline
running in user mode, process can't read/write the page 1, cause this page is defined to detect stack overflow or prevent the use of address below the stack.
